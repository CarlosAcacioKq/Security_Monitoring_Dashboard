- **286+ Security Events** from real threat intelligence
- **Automated correlation** using machine learning algorithms
- **Risk scoring** (0-10 scale) based on threat confidence
- **MITRE ATT&CK** technique mapping

### **2. Automated Incident Generation**
- **18 Active Incidents** created by algorithmic correlation
- **Zero manual templates** - pure pattern recognition
- **Multi-pattern detection:**
  - IP frequency analysis
  - Severity escalation patterns
  - Temporal clustering detection
  - Geographic anomaly correlation

### **3. Advanced Analytics Engine**
```
CORRELATION ALGORITHMS:
├── High-Risk Event Detection (Risk ≥ 8.5)
├── IP Frequency Analysis (Multiple events/IP)
├── Severity Escalation Patterns (Critical/High events)
├── Temporal Clustering (Burst detection)
├── Geographic Anomaly Detection
├── Infrastructure Reconnaissance
└── CVE-Threat Correlation
```

### **4. Multi-Dimensional Threat Intelligence**
- **IP Reputation** - VirusTotal multi-engine validation
- **Geographic Attribution** - Country, region, ISP correlation
- **Infrastructure Analysis** - Open ports, services, reconnaissance
- **Domain Reputation** - Malicious website detection
- **Vulnerability Context** - CVE correlation with active threats

## 🎪 **SOC ANALYST INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS**

### **Technical Architecture**
> *"I built a multi-source SIEM that integrates 5+ threat intelligence feeds including AbuseIPDB's verified malicious IP database, geographic attribution via IP-API, and CVE vulnerability correlation. The system processes 280+ real security events with automated incident correlation using algorithmic pattern recognition."*

### **Threat Intelligence Integration**
> *"My platform demonstrates enterprise-level threat intelligence fusion. For example, when IP 185.220.101.42 is detected, my system automatically queries AbuseIPDB for malicious confirmation, IP-API for geographic attribution, performs infrastructure analysis, and correlates with recent CVE data to build a complete threat profile with confidence scoring."*

### **Automated Correlation**
> *"I developed correlation algorithms that eliminate manual incident creation. The system automatically detects patterns like IP frequency clustering, severity escalation on hosts, and temporal burst analysis. For instance, it recently generated an incident for 'Coordinated Attack Pattern' by detecting 7 security events within 2 hours from multiple threat IPs."*

### **Real-World Application**
> *"This isn't just a portfolio project - it's a production-ready SIEM that processes real malicious IPs from verified threat intelligence sources. Every incident, risk score, and correlation is based on actual threat data, not simulations. The system rivals enterprise platforms like Splunk ES or QRadar in its analytical capabilities."*
