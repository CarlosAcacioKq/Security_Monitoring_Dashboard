# ⚠️ DEMO DATA DISCLAIMER

## **THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT**

All security data shown in this dashboard is **completely simulated and artificial**:

### **🎭 What is FAKE:**
- ✅ **All IP Addresses** - Pre-defined demo IPs (192.168.1.x, 10.0.0.x, etc.)
- ✅ **All Security Events** - Generated by Python faker/random libraries
- ✅ **All Incidents** - Created by correlation algorithms on fake data
- ✅ **All User Activity** - Simulated user behavior patterns
- ✅ **All Timestamps** - Artificially generated (may not match real time)
- ✅ **All MITRE Techniques** - Randomly assigned for demonstration

### **🎯 What is REAL:**
- ✅ **Detection Algorithms** - Genuine cybersecurity logic
- ✅ **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** - Industry-standard threat classifications  
- ✅ **Database Architecture** - Production-ready data models
- ✅ **Dashboard Technology** - Real Plotly/Dash web framework
- ✅ **Security Knowledge** - Authentic cybersecurity principles

### **📋 Purpose:**
This project demonstrates:
- **Technical Skills**: Python, SQL, web development, Docker
- **Security Knowledge**: Threat detection, incident response, compliance
- **System Architecture**: SIEM design, data processing, analytics
- **Portfolio Quality**: Professional-grade cybersecurity engineering

### **⚖️ Ethical Note:**
- **No Real Networks Monitored**
- **No Actual Security Breaches**
- **No Private Data Collected**
- **Pure Educational/Portfolio Demonstration**

### **🔍 For Recruiters/Employers:**
This showcases the **skills and knowledge** needed to build real security monitoring systems, using realistic but completely simulated data for demonstration purposes.

**If this were deployed in a real environment, it would monitor actual network traffic and generate genuine security alerts.**
